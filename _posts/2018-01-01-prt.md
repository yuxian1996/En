## Abstract
In this project, we implemented a technology named Precomputed Radiance Transfer for Real-Time Rendering in Dynamic, Low-Frequency Lighting Environments, which was frequently used in game engine. We precomputed a serial of coefficients and saved it, in run-time, used the coefficients to compute the color of every vertices quickly. We used a low-order spherical harmonic (SH) basis to represent such environments efficiently without aliasing.
