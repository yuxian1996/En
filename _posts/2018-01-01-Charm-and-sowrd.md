## Abstract
Charm and Sword is a Role-play VR game in which the player acts as a taoist, fight monsters, solve puzzles and find a way out.

## Features
* Player can draw different patterns to cast a spell to attack or attach it to the sword for puzzles.
* Motion capture is used in this game to improve immersion. Recognition is used for different spells.
* In order to increase the space in our virtual world, we explored a space re-usage technology and make the virtual world three times as the real world, or even more.
