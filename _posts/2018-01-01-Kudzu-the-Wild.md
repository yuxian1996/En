 I'm not a developer or designer. And I don't add footer to show who did this theme. If you like this theme or using it, please give a **star** for motivation, It makes me happy.

## Abstract
The Wilds is a God Simulator where you add animals to the environment in an attempt to maintain a balanced and healthy ecosystem. Invasive species are a constant threat in the game which must be dealt with and balanced against the native species

## Features
* Random events – campers and invasive species could strike at any moment and give the player something else to think about and contend with.
* Advanced creature AI – All of the animals in the game have a hunger meter and life meter. They all have predators and prey. They behave quite like real animals in a natural ecosystem.
* Season cycle – When you click the page turn, one year goes by and animals’ health goes down, and many other changes take effect in the environment.
* Carcasses and disease – When animals die, they turn into carcasses. Carcasses can spread disease and harm other animals. Vultures are needed to eat these carcasses, which adds one more thing for the player to consider.

## Site Setup
A quick checklist of the files you’ll want to edit to get up and running.    

### Site Wide Configuration
`_config.yml` is your friend. Open it up and personalize it. Most variables are self explanatory but here's an explanation of each if needed:

#### title

The title of your site... shocker!

Example `title: My Awesome Site`

#### bio

The description to show on your homepage.

#### description

The description to use for meta tags and navigation menu.

#### url

Used to generate absolute urls in `sitemap.xml`, `feed.xml`, and for generating canonical URLs in `<head>`. When developing locally either comment this out or use something like `http://localhost:4000` so all assets load properly. *Don't include a trailing `/`*.

Examples:

{% highlight yaml %}
url: http://taylantatli.me/Moon
url: http://localhost:4000
url: //cooldude.github.io
url:
{% endhighlight %}

#### reading_time

Set true to show reading time for posts. And set `words_per_minute`, default is 200.

#### logo
Your site's logo. It will show on homepage and navigation menu. Also used for twitter meta tags.

#### background
Image for background. If you don't set it, color will be used as a background.

#### Google Analytics and Webmaster Tools

Google Analytics UA and Webmaster Tool verification tags can be entered in `_config.yml`. For more information on obtaining these meta tags check [Google Webmaster Tools](http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=35179) and [Bing Webmaster Tools](https://ssl.bing.com/webmaster/configure/verify/ownership) support.

#### MathJax
It's enabled. But if you don't want to use it. Set it false in  `_config.yml`.

#### Disqus Comments
Set your disqus shortname in `_config.yml` to use comments.

---

### Navigation Links

To set what links appear in the top navigation edit `_data/navigation.yml`. Use the following format to set the URL and title for as many links as you'd like. *External links will open in a new window.*

{% highlight yaml %}
- title: Home
  url: /

- title: Blog
  url: /blog/

- title: Projects
  url: /projects/

- title: About
  url: /about/

- title: Moon
  url: http://taylantatli.me/Moon
{% endhighlight %}

## Layouts and Content

Moon Theme use [Jekyll Compress](https://github.com/penibelst/jekyll-compress-html) to compress html output. But it can cause errors if you use "linenos" (line numbers). I suggest don't use line numbers for codes, because it won't look good with this theme, also i didn't give a proper style for them. If you insist to use line numbers, just remove `layout: compress` string from layouts. It will disable compressing.

### Feature Image

You can set feature image per post. Just add `feature: some link` to your post's front matter.

```
feature: /assets/img/some-image.png
or
feaure: http://example.com/some-image.png
```    
 This also will be used for twitter card:

![Moon Twitter Card](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/754514/14509719/61c5751c-01d6-11e6-8c29-ce8ccad149bf.png)

### Comments
To show disqus comments for your post add `comments: true` to your post's front matter.
